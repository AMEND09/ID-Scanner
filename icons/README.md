# PWA Icons

This directory contains icons for the Progressive Web App. The manifest.json file references these icons with different sizes for various devices and contexts.

## Required Icons

The following icon sizes are specified in the manifest.json file:
- 72x72 pixels
- 96x96 pixels
- 128x128 pixels
- 144x144 pixels
- 152x152 pixels
- 192x192 pixels
- 384x384 pixels
- 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Proper Icons

To create proper PWA icons:

1. Start with a high-resolution source image (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Use an online favicon generator or image editing software to create all required sizes
3. Ensure your icon has a simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
4. Save each icon in PNG format

## Recommended Tools

1. [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
2. [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
3. Image editing software like GIMP or Photoshop

## Important Notes

- The current placeholder files (created with `echo.`) are not real images and won't work in production
- Replace all placeholder files with actual PNG icons
- Make sure the icons have transparent backgrounds for best display on different themes
- Consider the app's branding when designing the icons
